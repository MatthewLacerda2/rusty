//! src/procgen/hash.rs — dependency-free deterministic value hashing.
//!
//! Every stochastic op (white noise, noise jitter, Voronoi cell points) draws its
//! randomness from a pure integer hash of `(x, y, seed)` — never from `rand` (the
//! project has no `rand` crate, by design) and never from wall-clock. Because the
//! hash is a pure function of its inputs, the same recipe + seed always produces the
//! same buffer, which is what makes a bake byte-identical across runs.
//!
//! The mixer is the SplitMix64 / PCG-style integer finalizer: a handful of
//! xor-shift + odd-multiply rounds with good avalanche. It needs no state and no
//! crate, and over the integer-coordinate lattice the procedural ops sample it is
//! more than random enough for texture work.

/// 64-bit avalanche mixer (the SplitMix64 finalizer). Pure: identical input ⇒
/// identical output, the contract the determinism requirement rests on.
