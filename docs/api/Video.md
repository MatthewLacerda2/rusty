## `Video`

Runtime **video** settings for the windowed app — framebuffer resolution, vsync, and
fullscreen. Kept separate from `Graphics` (which drives per-volume post-FX + the
quality tier) because these are window/surface state, not scene-graph state — the
same split Unity draws between `Screen` and `QualitySettings`.

| Function | Signature | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `Video.GetResolution` / `SetResolution` | `()` / `(width, height)` | `width, height` (each clamped ≥ 1) |
| `Video.GetVsync` / `SetVsync` | `()` / `(bool)` | `bool` |
| `Video.GetFullscreen` / `SetFullscreen` | `()` / `(bool)` | `bool` |

A `Video.*` setter writes a shared settings cell that the platform layer reads each
frame and applies: resolution and vsync reconfigure the wgpu surface, fullscreen
toggles the winit window (borderless). Vsync off requests the surface's `Immediate`
present mode; if the backend doesn't support it, vsync stays on and `GetVsync`
reports the true state. Settings persist through the `video` `Storage` namespace
(loaded at startup, flushed on Stop / quit), so the app relaunches as last set. In
the headless harness there is no window/surface, so the setters are inert.

**Determinism.** Like `Graphics`, every `Video` write is **one-way** into
render/platform state and is never read by `FixedUpdate`, so it cannot change how
the deterministic sim evolves; a headless replay is unaffected.
